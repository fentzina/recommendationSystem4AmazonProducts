## *Building a recommendation system to recommend the best Amazon products to users*

This project involves recommending the best Amazon products available to users based on past rating data using recommendation systems techniques.  Skills &amp; Tools Covered: Rank-based Recommendation Systems, Similarity-based Recommendation Systems, Matrix Factorization based Recommendation Systems
The dataset contains ratings of different electronic products. It does not include information about the products or reviews to avoid bias while building the model.

### Objective:
You are a Data Science Manager at Amazon, and have been given the task of building a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products. You have a collection of labeled data of Amazon reviews of products. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and build a recommendation system that helps in recommending products to online consumers.

### Dataset:
The Amazon dataset contains the following attributes:

* userId: Every user identified with a unique id
* productId: Every product identified with a unique id
* Rating: The rating of the corresponding product by the corresponding user
* timestamp: Time of the rating. We will not use this column to solve the current problem
